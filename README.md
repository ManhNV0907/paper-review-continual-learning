A hub for paper reviews in Continual Learning

## Brief overview
To start with CL, break your mind first with [some notable things](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/start.md)

CL is also frequently used interchangably with other [terms](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/terminologies.md)

CL is sometimes misunderstood by other domains but pretty similar, refer [here](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/distinguish.md) to distinguish.

And to evaluate a CL system, some benchmarks should be mentioned [here](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/evaluate.md) and reinforced by V. Lomonaco [here](https://vlomonaco.github.io/core50/benchmarks.html)

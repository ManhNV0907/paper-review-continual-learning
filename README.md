A hub for paper reviews in Continual Learning (Lifelong Learning/Incremental Learning)

## Brief overview
To start with CL, break your mind first with [some notable things](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/start.md)

CL is also frequently used interchangably with other [terms](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/terminologies.md)

CL is sometimes misunderstood by other domains but pretty similar, refer [here](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/distinguish.md) to distinguish.

And to evaluate a CL system, some benchmarks should be mentioned [here](https://github.com/luulinh90s/paper-review-continual-learning/blob/master/evaluate.md) and reinforced by V. Lomonaco [here](https://vlomonaco.github.io/core50/benchmarks.html). Another benchmark to be considerd is could be refer [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12488).

However, the gap in Continual learning is that **Humans can learn a variety of concepts and skills incrementally over the course of their lives while exhibiting an array of desirable properties, such as non-forgetting, concept rehearsal, forward transfer and backward transfer of knowledge, few-shot learning, and selective forgetting. However, current methods are mostly focusing on addressing catastrophic forgetting. From that, we can argue that we have a long long way to go if we wanna achieve the real life-long learning ability.**

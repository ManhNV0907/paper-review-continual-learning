## TL;DR

**The authors state that in the
beginning the network is a blank slate with no nodes at all. It develops
according to four rules: (i) expansion, which adds new nodes to memorize
new input combinations; (ii) generalization, which adds new nodes that
generalize from existing ones; (iii) forgetting, which removes nodes that
are of relatively little use; and (iv) backpropagation, which fine-tunes the
network parameters. They analyze the model from the perspective of accuracy, energy efficiency, and versatility and compare it to other network
models, finding better performance in several cases**

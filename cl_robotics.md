## TL;DR

**Authors propose a framework to link continual learning to robotics. This framework also sets
the opportunities for continual learning to have a framed mathematical formulation to present
approaches in a clear and systematic way. First they present the context and the history of continual
learning. Secondly, they aim at disentangling vocabulary around continual learning to have a clear
basis. Thirdly, they introduce the framework as a standard way of presenting CL approaches to help
transfer between different fields of continual learning, especially to robotics. Fourthly, they present a
set of metrics that will help to better understand the quality and shortcomings of every family of
approaches. Finally, they present the specifics and opportunities of continual learning in robotics
that make CL so crucial**

We consider continual learning a synonym of Incremental Learning (Gepperth and Hammer,
2016; Rebuffi et al., 2016), Lifelong Learning (Chen and Liu, 2018; Thrun and Mitchell, 1995) and
Never Ending Learning
